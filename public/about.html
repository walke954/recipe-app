				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>'Little Text' is a community app that emphasizes minimalist text sharing. The idea is that when text output is limited in quantity, quality becomes essential.</p>
				<h2>How does it work?</h2>
				<p>The core of 'Little Text' is, well, the little text, which is has a maximum of '' characters and can be given a title. Texts can be created privately in the 'Archive' section without being seen publicly. To make public, a text has to be pushed into the 'Published' section. Take care in what you push though, since only a maximum of '' texts can be published at any given time.</p>
				<h2>How do I connect with others?</h2>
				<p>Little texts can be marked with a 'showcase' tag. Texts with this tag will be displayed to other browsing users. If no texts are marked, then the first text in your published section will be showcased. As you browse other people's works, you will have the option to create a link. Links will be remembered for later in case you want to return to a specific user's texts.</p>
